Minimalist Markdown Blog
====

My minimalist markdown blog. Done for a coding blog.

Currently silex based, markdown and pygment colourful coding, calls directly to markdown stored on the server.

Eventually to be moved to MCB (Minimalist Coders Blog) for more broader use. Developers can then implement their
own article providers (file, git, cmf etc), formating and highlighters (e.g. pygments, geshi etc).

Lots of stuff to do it in, probably not useful for others :-)
