Minimalist Markdown Blog
====

This project is for the development of my minimalist markdown blog. Not really useful for others yet.

Currently it sources a path for files, mapping to the /article/{file} route. Will format markdown files and highlight
the fenced code using pygment.

Lots of stuff to do it in. :-)

Uses:
- Silex
- Parsedown
- Pygments
- Configuration

TODO
- Refactor to be composer install
- Use in your own projects
